So, I've been trying to think of ways that I can "help the war effort" in terms of freedom versus tyrany - exactly the war Ukraine is fighting for right now.

Today I came across this company: [helsing.ai](https://helsing.ai), hat-tip to [Ukraine: The Latest](https://open.spotify.com/show/6cnkk1J0I1UqtxTYVUL4Fe?si=e7c61871e2eb47f0) for [interviewing Benjamin Tallis](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5H1P61jVeY3eFvYsyxabAP?si=08a9f738c86d4e71) and bringing them to our attention.

I would like to support their work (their strapline is `Protecting Democracies`), and if there is some way I can add value to their operation then that's a win in my view.

Now, I certainly don't want a job, but I think I can help them find and employ the best of the bunch. 

To that end, I have submitted a proposal via their job application portal. The job title on the form I submitted was "Talent Aquisition Partner", which I think is appropriate;

I particularly liked this note in the job bumf:

> Note: The above bullet points describe the ideal candidate. None of us matched all of these at once when we first joined Helsing. We encourage you to apply even if you believe you meet only part of our wish list.
