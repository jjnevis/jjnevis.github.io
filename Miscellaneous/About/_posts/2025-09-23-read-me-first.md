Welcome to Jay's Open Source Solutions.

This site is a continually changing, but up-to-date, repository of solution information and other stuff.

Start by investigating the menu.  

There are current [solutions]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) that you can get involved with and contribute to (using [giscus](https://github.com/marketplace/giscus) or any contact method: [@jjnevis]({{ site.social.links.first }})).  

Then there are posts discussing anything, including the 
[solutions]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) and related topics. They can be organised by [Latest]({% link _tabs/latest.md %}),
You can also use the search function, which is always the fastest way to get to where you want to be, particularly if you've been there before.  

Finally there is a list of [ideas]({% link _tabs/ideas.md %}) for future solution projects, big and small. Who knows - perhaps one day they will be funded by Onus.  

This post will be updated as more detail becomes clear - I have a lot in my head right now and it's going to take me some time to get it all out.  

It's worth remembering that there is zero commercialism involved in this, it is all open source - free and no ads.
