This site is a continually developing broadcast of jjnevis's open source solutions.

Start by investigating the menu on the lefthand side, there are current [Solutions]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) that you can get involved with and contribute to - they are all open source and democratic.

Then there are posts discussing anything, including the solutions and related topics. They can are organised by 
[Recent]({% link _tabs/latest.md %}),
[Categories]({% link _tabs/categories.md %}) or 
[tags]({% link _tabs/tags.md %})
but you can always search using the box at top right.

Finally there are a list of ideas for future solution projects, big and small.
This post will be updated as more detail becomes clear.
Thank you for your interest.
