Welcome to jjnevis's Open Source Solutions.

This site is a continually changing repository of solution information and other stuff.

Start by investigating the menu.

There are current [`solutions`]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) that you can get involved with and contribute to (using [giscus](https://github.com/marketplace/giscus) or any contact method: [@jjnevis]({{ site.social.links.first }})).

The [`Journal`]({% link _tabs/journal.md %}) contains posts about anything, including the [`solutions`]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) and related topics.

[`Categories`]({% link _tabs/categories.md %}),  [`Tags`]({% link _tabs/tags.md %}), and [`Latest`]({% link _tabs/latest.md %}) are different ways to find posts in the [`solutions`]({% link _tabs/solutions.md %}) or [`Journal`]({% link _tabs/journal.md %}).

You can also use the search function (top right), which is always the fastest way to get to where you want to be, particularly if you've been there before.

This post will be updated as more detail becomes clear - I have a lot in my head right now and it's going to take me some time to get it all out.  

It's worth remembering that there is zero commercialism involved in this, it is all open source.

Jay
